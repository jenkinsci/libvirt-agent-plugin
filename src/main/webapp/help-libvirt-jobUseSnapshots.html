        Configure snapshots for libvirt. Blank values will cause no revert to happen. It is recommended that you use labels to restrict which nodes this job runs on, unless all of your nodes are identical. Consistent naming of snapshots between the allowed nodes is important for this feature to operate correctly. The virtual machine nodes must be configured for a single executor with this option defined, otherwise a job performing a revert on one executor will interrupt the jobs running on the others.
